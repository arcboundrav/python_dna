A population of feedforward neural networks with a pre-defined architecture are randomly initialized.
Which nodes are connected and the weights of those connections are subject to optimization through the use of a genetic algorithm.
The algorithm is adapted from the approach described in Stanley and Mikkulainen's 2002 paper, Evolving Neural Networks Through Augmenting Topologies.

The project is a proof of concept. The approach successfully evolves a network which is able to approximate an arbitrary value between 0 and 1 to within a margin of error of 0.0001.
